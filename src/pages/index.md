<!-- ## An Eleventy starter

This (opiniated) [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) starter is based on [Andy Bell's](https://mastodon.social/@andy@bell.bz) talk 'Be the browserâ€™s mentor, not its micromanager' and it's companion website buildexcellentwebsit.es.

In his words, it's about hinting the browser rather than micromanaging it, using progressive enhancement, CSS layout, fluid type & spacing, as well as modern CSS features.

This way we can shape frontends that look good to everyone, regardless of device, connection speed or context.
